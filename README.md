# SortAlgorithms
A sorting Algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list into an order. The most frequently used orders are numerical and lexicographical order, and either ascending or descending order. Efficient optimization is key for good sorting algorithms. The best one yet is the quick sort algorithm with the time complexity of O(n log n) on average and O(n^2) for worst case. Above is the implementation of thought-experiement-esque sorting algorithms that technically can beat or come close to beating the quick sort algorithm, but are highly unlikely when considering the best and worst case scenario for sleep and array sort.
