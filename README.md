# SortAlgorithms
Sorting Algorithms is an algorithm that puts elements of a list into an order. The most frequently used orders are numerical and lexicographical order, and either ascending or descending order. Efficient and optimization are key for a good sorting algorithms. The best one yet is the quick sort algorithm with the time complexity of O(n log n) on average and O(n^2) for worst case. Above are implementation of thought-experiement esque sorting algorithms that technically can beat or come close to beating the quick sort algorithm, but highly unlikely when considering the best and worst case scenerio for sleep and array sort.
